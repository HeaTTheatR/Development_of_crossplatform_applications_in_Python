After reading this book, you will learn how to create modern cross-platform
applications using the Python programming language, the [Kivy framework](https://github.com/kivy/kivy)
and the [KivyMD](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) library of material design components (Google material design).
Get introduce with the MVC template and competent application architecture.
Using the example of a real application (a simplified analogue of the Telegram messenger),
we will go through all the stages of application development, starting from installing the necessary libraries,
necessary tools and ending with the assembly of installation packages of the application we created for Android,
Mac OS, Windows, and Linux platforms.

_The book does not give knowledge about the Python programming language,
so you should have the appropriate knowledge of this language at a fairly good level._

### How can you read this

I hope that as you read this book, you will help make it better with your suggestions and comments.
This book will be free. And as soon as the last chapters are published here,
I will transfer the book to free use. And while the book is at the writing stage,
you can read it on the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kivymd).


On the first day of each month, I will publish several chapters of this book in English and Russian.
The book turns out to be very large, so I assume that the publication of the entire book will take from six months to a year.
